This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Trail Task 1

This application is a coding trial for ClimateScience with requirements as follows:

1. Set up and deploy on Vercel.com
2. Code a css animation to match the design presented and deploy it on the index page of the app.
3. Set up the project to use proper i18n structure

i18n is a new tool for me. That said - I read different ways to set it up, so I'm not sure what the 'proper' way is yet. Once I am able to view how it is set up in a project, I will be able to implement those conventions.
